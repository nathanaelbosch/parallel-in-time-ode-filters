# Parallel-in-time ODE Filters


## Project environment setup
The project uses [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
After installing poetry, you should be able to initialize the project with just
```
poetry install
```


## Testing
Just use [`tox`](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/):
```
tox -e py3
```
Or even just `tox` to also run [`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) and [`isort`](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/).
